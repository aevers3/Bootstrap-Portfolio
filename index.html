                <p>I graduated from Bloomsburg University in 2013 with a Bachelor's Degree in English. I was hired
                    and worked in publishing for the next several years. Although I was initially hired as an
                    editor, my time at the company exposed me to the Adobe Creative Suite and gave me my first
                    experience working with simple front end code. Until this point, I'd never considered myself a
                    "computer person," but I started realizing that while coding can seem daunting, it's not
                    impossible to learn and understand. With this mindset, I started to enjoy code more over time.</p>
                <p>After some varied results in teaching myself to code proficiently, I enrolled in the Penn LPS
                    Coding Boot Camp to build onto my limited coding skill set. Upon completion of the program,
                    I'll be seeking a job that will allow me to further develop my skills and knowledge.</p>
                <p>In my free time, I like to play music and have been a guitarist and bassist for most of my life.
                    Other hobbies of mine include cooking, watching movies, and training in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.
                    Regardless of the activity, I really enjoy learning about the things that interest me. I
                    consider myself a lifelong learner in both my professional and personal lives.</p>
